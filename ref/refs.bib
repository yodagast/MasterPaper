Here, we present a novel approach to relational learning based on the factorization of a three-way tensor. We show that unlike other tensor approaches, our method is able to perform collective learning via the latent components of the model and provide an efficient algorithm to compute the factorization. We substantiate our theoretical considerations regarding the collective learning capabilities of our model by the means of experiments on both a new dataset and a dataset commonly used in entity resolution. Furthermore, we show on common benchmark datasets that our approach achieves better or on-par results, if compared to current state-of-the-art relational learning solutions, while it is significantly faster to compute.},

abstract = {Scientific literature with rich metadata can be represented as a labeled directed graph. This graph representation enables a number of scientific tasks such as ad hoc retrieval or named entity recognition (NER) to be formulated as typed proximity queries in the graph. One popular proximity measure is called Random Walk with Restart (RWR), and much work has been done on the supervised learning of RWR measures by associating each edge label with a parameter. In this paper, we describe a novel learnable proximity measure which instead uses one weight per edge label sequence: proximity is defined by a weighted combination of simple "path experts", each corresponding to following a particular sequence of labeled edges. Experiments on eight tasks in two subdomains of biology show that the new learning method significantly outperforms the RWR model (both trained and untrained). We also extend the method to support two additional types of experts to model intrinsic properties of entities: query-independent experts, which generalize the PageRank measure, and popular entity experts which allow rankings to be adjusted for particular entities that are especially important. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Author(s).},

abstract = {Tensor factorization has become a popular method for learning from multi-relational data. In this context, the rank of the factorization is an important parame-ter that determines runtime as well as generalization ability. To identify conditions under which factorization is an efficient approach for learning from relational data, we derive upper and lower bounds on the rank required to recover adjacency tensors. Based on our findings, we propose a novel additive tensor factorization model to learn from latent and observable patterns on multi-relational data and present a scalable algorithm for computing the factorization. We show experimentally both that the proposed additive model does improve the predictive performance over pure latent variable methods and that it also reduces the required rank¡ªand therefore runtime and memory complexity¡ªsignificantly.},

For the range of values of multiple moments that we consider, the horizon is deformed much less than its corresponding shadow, suggesting the horizon is more `rigid'. Quite unexpectedly we find that a prolate distortion of the horizon gives rise to an oblate distortion of the shadow, and vice-versa.},

abstract = {Recently, several large-scale RDF knowledge bases have been built and applied in many knowledge-based applications. To further increase the number of facts in RDF knowledge bases, logic rules can be used to predict new facts based on the existing ones. Therefore, how to automatically learn reliable rules from large-scale knowledge bases becomes increasingly important. In this paper, we propose a novel rule learning approach named RDF2Rules for RDF knowledge bases. RDF2Rules first mines frequent predicate cycles (FPCs), a kind of interesting frequent patterns in knowledge bases, and then generates rules from the mined FPCs. Because each FPC can produce multiple rules, and effective pruning strategy is used in the process of mining FPCs, RDF2Rules works very efficiently. Another advantage of RDF2Rules is that it uses the entity type information when generates and evaluates rules, which makes the learned rules more accurate. Experiments show that our approach outperforms the compared approach in terms of both efficiency and accuracy.},

abstract = {Knowledge base (KB) completion adds new facts to a KB by making inferences from existing facts, for example by inferring with high likelihood nationality(X,Y) from bornIn(X,Y). Most previous methods infer simple one-hop relational synonyms like this, or use as evidence a multi-hop relational path treated as an atomic feature, like bornIn(X,Z) -{\textgreater} containedIn(Z,Y). This paper presents an approach that reasons about conjunctions of multi-hop relations non-atomically, composing the implications of a path using a recursive neural network (RNN) that takes as inputs vector embeddings of the binary relation in the path. Not only does this allow us to generalize to paths unseen at training time, but also, with a single high-capacity RNN, to predict new relation types not seen when the compositional model was trained (zero-shot learning). We assemble a new dataset of over 52M relational triples, and show that our method improves over a traditional classifier by 11{\%}, and a method leveraging pre-trained embeddings by 7{\%}.},

We show that the random walk probabilities computed (at great expense) by PRA provide no discernible benefit to performance on this task, so they can safely be dropped. This allows us to define a simpler algorithm for generating feature matrices from graphs, which we call subgraph feature extraction (SFE). In addition to being conceptually simpler than PRA, SFE is much more efficient, reducing computation by an order of magnitude, and more expressive, allowing for much richer features than paths between two nodes in a graph. We show experimentally that this technique gives substantially better performance than PRA and its variants, improving mean average precision from .432 to .528 on a knowledge base completion task using the NELL KB.},

abstract = {Recent years have witnessed a proliferation of large-scale knowledge graphs, such as Freebase, YAGO, Google's Knowledge Graph, and Microsoft's Satori. Whereas there is a large body of research on mining homogeneous graphs, this new generation of information networks are highly heterogeneous, with thousands of entity and relation types and billions of instances of vertices and edges. In this tutorial, we will present the state of the art in constructing, mining, and growing knowledge graphs. The purpose of the tutorial is to equip newcomers to this exciting field with an understanding of the basic concepts, tools and methodologies, available datasets, and open research challenges. A publicly available knowledge base (Freebase) will be used throughout the tutorial to exemplify the different techniques.},

@article{Nickel2016,
abstract = {Relational machine learning studies methods for the statistical analysis of relational, or graph-structured, data. In this paper, we provide a review of how such statistical models can be "trained" on large knowledge graphs, and then used to predict new facts about the world (which is equivalent to predicting new edges in the graph). In particular, we discuss two fundamentally different kinds of statistical relational models, both of which can scale to massive datasets. The first is based on latent feature models such as tensor factorization and multiway neural networks. The second is based on mining observable patterns in the graph. We also show how to combine these latent and observable models to get improved modeling power at decreased computational cost. Finally, we discuss how such statistical models of graphs can be combined with text-based information extraction methods for automatically constructing knowledge graphs from the Web. To this end, we also discuss Google's Knowledge Vault project as an example of such combination.},
